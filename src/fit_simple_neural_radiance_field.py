# # Fit a simple Neural Radiance Field via raymarching
# 
# This tutorial shows how to fit Neural Radiance Field given a set of views of a scene using differentiable implicit function rendering.
# 
# More specifically, this tutorial will explain how to:
# 1. Create a differentiable implicit function renderer with either image-grid or Monte Carlo ray sampling.
# 2. Create an Implicit model of a scene.
# 3. Fit the implicit function (Neural Radiance Field) based on input images using the differentiable implicit renderer. 
# 4. Visualize the learnt implicit function.
# 
# Note that the presented implicit model is a simplified version of NeRF:<br>
# _Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Matthew Tancik, Jonathan T. Barron, Ravi Ramamoorthi, Ren Ng: NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis, ECCV 2020._
# 
# The simplifications include:
# * *Ray sampling*: This notebook does not perform stratified ray sampling but rather ray sampling at equidistant depths.
# * *Rendering*: We do a single rendering pass, as opposed to the original implementation that does a coarse and fine rendering pass.
# * *Architecture*: Our network is shallower which allows for faster optimization possibly at the cost of surface details.
# * *Mask loss*: Since our observations include segmentation masks, we also optimize a silhouette loss that forces rays to either get fully absorbed inside the volume, or to completely pass through it.

# 1. A batch of image and silhouette tensors that are produced by the cow mesh renderer.

# ## 2. Initialize the implicit renderer
# 
# The following initializes an implicit renderer that emits a ray from each pixel of a target image and samples a set of uniformly-spaced points along the ray. At each ray-point, the corresponding density and color value is obtained by querying the corresponding location in the neural model of the scene (the model is described & instantiated in a later cell).
# 
# The renderer is composed of a *raymarcher* and a *raysampler*.
# - The *raysampler* is responsible for emitting rays from image pixels and sampling the points along them. Here, we use two different raysamplers:
#     - `MonteCarloRaysampler` is used to generate rays from a random subset of pixels of the image plane. The random subsampling of pixels is carried out during **training** to decrease the memory consumption of the implicit model.
#     - `NDCMultinomialRaysampler` which follows the standard PyTorch3D coordinate grid convention (+X from right to left; +Y from bottom to top; +Z away from the user). In combination with the implicit model of the scene, `NDCMultinomialRaysampler` consumes a large amount of memory and, hence, is only used for visualizing the results of the training at **test** time.
# - The *raymarcher* takes the densities and colors sampled along each ray and renders each ray into a color and an opacity value of the ray's source pixel. Here we use the `EmissionAbsorptionRaymarcher` which implements the standard Emission-Absorption raymarching algorithm.

# In[ ]:


# render_size describes the size of both sides of the 
# rendered images in pixels. Since an advantage of 
# Neural Radiance Fields are high quality renders
# with a significant amount of details, we render
# the implicit function at double the size of 
# target images.
render_size = target_images.shape[1] * 2

# Our rendered scene is centered around (0,0,0) 
# and is enclosed inside a bounding box
# whose side is roughly equal to 3.0 (world units).

# Here, we use the standard EmissionAbsorptionRaymarcher 
# which marches along each ray in order to render
# the ray into a single 3D color vector 
# and an opacity scalar.
raymarcher = EmissionAbsorptionRaymarcher()

# Finally, instantiate the implicit renders
# for both raysamplers.

    raysampler=raysampler_grid, raymarcher=raymarcher,
)
renderer_mc = ImplicitRenderer(
    raysampler=raysampler_mc, raymarcher=raymarcher,
)


# ## 3. Define the neural radiance field model
# 
# In this cell we define the `NeuralRadianceField` module, which specifies a continuous field of colors and opacities over the 3D domain of the scene.
# 
# The `forward` function of `NeuralRadianceField` (NeRF) receives as input a set of tensors that parametrize a bundle of rendering rays. The ray bundle is later converted to 3D ray points in the world coordinates of the scene. Each 3D point is then mapped to a harmonic representation using the `HarmonicEmbedding` layer (defined in the next cell). The harmonic embeddings then enter the _color_ and _opacity_ branches of the NeRF model in order to label each ray point with a 3D vector and a 1D scalar ranging in [0-1] which define the point's RGB color and opacity respectively.
# 
# Since NeRF has a large memory footprint, we also implement the `NeuralRadianceField.forward_batched` method. The method splits the input rays into batches and executes the `forward` function for each batch separately in a for loop. This lets us render a large set of rays without running out of GPU memory. Standardly, `forward_batched` would be used to render rays emitted from all pixels of an image in order to produce a full-sized render of a scene.

# ## 5. Fit the radiance field
# 
# Here we carry out the radiance field fitting with differentiable rendering.
# 
# In order to fit the radiance field, we render it from the viewpoints of the `target_cameras`
# and compare the resulting renders with the observed `target_images` and `target_silhouettes`.
# 
# The comparison is done by evaluating the mean huber (smooth-l1) error between corresponding
# pairs of `target_images`/`rendered_images` and `target_silhouettes`/`rendered_silhouettes`.
# 
# Since we use the `MonteCarloRaysampler`, the outputs of the training renderer `renderer_mc`
# are colors of pixels that are randomly sampled from the image plane, not a lattice of pixels forming
# a valid image. Thus, in order to compare the rendered colors with the ground truth, we 
# utilize the random MonteCarlo pixel locations to sample the ground truth images/silhouettes
# `target_silhouettes`/`rendered_silhouettes` at the xy locations corresponding to the render
# locations. This is done with the helper function `sample_images_at_mc_locs`, which is
# described in the previous cell.

# ## 7. Conclusion
# 
# In this tutorial, we have shown how to optimize an implicit representation of a scene such that the renders of the scene from known viewpoints match the observed images for each viewpoint. The rendering was carried out using the PyTorch3D's implicit function renderer composed of either a `MonteCarloRaysampler` or `NDCMultinomialRaysampler`, and an `EmissionAbsorptionRaymarcher`.
